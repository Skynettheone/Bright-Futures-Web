    <h2>Solar Power</h2>
    <p>Solar power harnesses energy from the sun to generate electricity in a clean and sustainable way. The cost of solar technology has dropped significantly, making it a practical choice for homes and businesses around the world. It is especially valuable in rural areas where grid access is limited.</p>

  <section id="wind">
    <h2>Wind Power</h2>
    <p>Wind power is another key pillar of renewable energy. By using large wind turbines to capture the kinetic energy of wind and convert it into electricity, we can generate clean and sustainable power. Wind farms can be built on land or offshore, providing flexibility and scale. In many countries, wind energy is now among the cheapest forms of new electricity generation.</p>
